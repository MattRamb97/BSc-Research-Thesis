# Classification of Normal vs Malignant Cells in B-ALL White Blood Cancer Microscopic Image: ISBI 2019

In this challenge, a dataset of cells with labels (normal versus malignant) will be provided to train machine learning based classifier to identify normal cells from leukemic blasts (malignant cells). These cells (as shown above in figure-1) have been segmented from the images after those images have been stain normalized. The overall size of the images were 2560x1920, while a single cell image is roughly of the size of 300x300 pixels. The images are representative of images in the real-world because these contain some staining noise and illumination errors, although these errors have largely been fixed by us via our own inhouse method on stain normalization [1,2].

The ground truth has been marked by the expert oncologist. The aim of the challenge is to compare and rank the different competing methods developed by participants based on the performance metrics such as accuracy and F1 scores.
